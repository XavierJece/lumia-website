To draft the PRD, I need a few clarifications:

1. Problem & goals: What business/user problem should the new home page solve, and how will success be measured (e.g., conversion to contact, time on page, bounce rate)?
2. Users & stories: Who is the primary visitor (e.g., SME owners, compliance managers)? Key jobs-to-be-done for them on the home page?
3. Scope: Are we only updating layout/content per the provided brief, or should we add any new sections/interactions (e.g., animated timeline, CTA behaviors)? What is explicitly out of scope?
4. Constraints & dependencies: Any technical/design system constraints, CMS limitations, or deadlines to respect?
5. Experience & design: Should we strictly follow the provided colors/patterns and existing design system components, or can we introduce new UI elements/illustrations? Any accessibility or performance requirements to highlight?
   Feel free to add any other must-have CTAs, links, or assets.

1. Conversion rate based on contact and time spent on page.
2. SME owners, rest assured that LUMIA can be a solution to the problem your company is facing.
3. Out of scope: Creation of any new website page and any backend needs. Within scope: All frontend updates and the need to create new content, as well as animations and components necessary for a new page structure.
4. No technical issues; everything must be done directly on the page.
5. Yes, you can insert new user interface elements/illustrations, always after my approval. Yes, there is a need for attention to accessibility and performance, and extra care must be taken with SEO. Remember to be mobile-first.
