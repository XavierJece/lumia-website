# Technical Specification Template

## Executive Summary

[Provide a brief technical overview of the solution approach. Summarize the main architectural decisions and implementation strategy in 1-2 paragraphs.]

## System Architecture

### Component Overview

[Brief description of the main components and their responsibilities:

- Component names and primary functions
- Key relationships between components
- Data flow overview]

## Implementation Design

### Main Interfaces

[Define main service interfaces (≤20 lines per example):

```go
// Example interface definition
type ServiceName interface {
    MethodName(ctx context.Context, input Type) (output Type, error)
}
```

]

### Data Models

[Define essential data structures:

- Main domain entities (if applicable)
- Request/response types
- Database schemas (if applicable)]

### API Endpoints

[List API endpoints if applicable:

- Method and path (e.g., `POST /api/v0/resource`)
- Brief description
- Request/response format references]

## Integration Points

[Include only if functionality requires external integrations:

- External services or APIs
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling approach]

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

[Describe unit testing strategy:

- Main components to test
- Mock requirements (external services only)
- Critical test scenarios]

### Integration Tests

[If needed, describe integration tests:

- Components to test together
- Test data requirements]

## Development Sequencing

### Build Order

[Define implementation sequence:

1. First component/functionality (why first)
2. Second component/functionality (dependencies)
3. Subsequent components
4. Integration and testing]

### Technical Dependencies

[List any blocking dependencies:

- Required infrastructure
- External service availability]

## Monitoring and Observability

[Define monitoring approach using existing infrastructure:

- Metrics to expose (Prometheus format)
- Key logs and log levels
- Integration with existing Grafana dashboards

## Technical Considerations

### Key Decisions

[Document important technical decisions:

- Approach choice and justification
- Trade-offs considered
- Alternatives rejected and why]

### Known Risks

[Identify technical risks:

- Potential challenges
- Mitigation approaches
- Areas needing research]
