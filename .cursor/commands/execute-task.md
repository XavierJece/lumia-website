# execute-task

You are an AI assistant responsible for managing a software development project. Your task is to identify the next available task, perform the necessary configuration, and prepare to start work.

## Information Provided

## File Locations

- PRD: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/prd.md`
- Tech Spec: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/techspec.md`
- Tasks: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/tasks.md`
- Project Rules: @.cursor/rules

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Pre-Task Setup

- Read the task definition
- Review the PRD context
- Check technical spec requirements
- Understand dependencies on previous tasks

### 2. Task Analysis

Analyze considering:

- Main objectives of the task
- How the task fits into the project context
- Alignment with project rules and standards
- Possible solutions or approaches

### 3. Task Summary

```
Task ID: [ID or number]
Task Name: [Name or brief description]
PRD Context: [Main points of the PRD]
Tech Spec Requirements: [Main technical requirements]
Dependencies: [List of dependencies]
Main Objectives: [Primary objectives]
Risks/Challenges: [Identified risks or challenges]
```

### 4. Approach Plan

```
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]
```

## Important Notes

- Always check against PRD, technical spec, and task file
- Implement appropriate solutions **without using workarounds**
- Follow all established project standards

## Implementation

After providing the summary and approach, immediately begin implementing the task:

- Execute necessary commands
- Make code changes
- Follow established project standards
- Ensure that all requirements are met
